Seeking retribution for his younger brother Frieza after he was defeated, Cooler attacks Gokuu; however, the latter manages to escape with Gohan Son and goes into hiding. Unsatisfied and infuriated with the outcome, Cooler and his men begin the hunt to uncover Gokuu's location and kill him to carry out their plans of exacting revenge.[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
