  "description": "The summer holidays are coming to an end, but the girls from Houkago Tea Time want to take one more trip before their next semester starts. With countless travel destinations to choose from and as many preferences as there are club members, coming to an agreement seems far-flung.\n\nUnable to reach a decision, they remember that they must first apply for new passports. As simple as it may sound, the routine visit to a government office and filing a form soon turns into an all-day adventure for Yui Hirasawa and the rest of the band.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
