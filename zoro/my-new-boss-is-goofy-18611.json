  "description": "Momose, a 26-year-old office worker, recently changed jobs after being harassed by his former boss. He is concerned that his new boss will also use power harassment to make his life miserable. Momose tries to hide his concern about facing a similar situation with his new boss, Shirasaki. To Momose's surprise, however, Shirasaki's inherent airheadedness immediately alleviates all of his concerns, giving him a sense of relief.",
