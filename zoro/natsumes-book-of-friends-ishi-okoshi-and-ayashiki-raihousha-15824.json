  "description": "The film will be made up of two stories: \"Ishi Okoshi\" and \"Ayashiki Raihousha.\" In \"Ishi Okoshi,\" Natsume meets a small youkai called Mitsumi in a forest. Mitsumi is entrusted to wake up the divine youkai \"Iwatetsu\" from its deep slumber. Mitsumi weighs on Natsume's mind, so he sets out to help Mitsumi with his task.\n\nIn \"Ayashiki Raihousha,\" a mysterious visitor appears in front of Tanuma. Nearly every day, the visitor visits Tanuma, talks to him a little, and then leaves. Natsume, who knows the visitor is a youkai, worries for Tanuma, but Tanuma enjoys these exchanges with the youkai. The youkai means no harm, but Tanuma's health slowly starts to deteriorate.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
