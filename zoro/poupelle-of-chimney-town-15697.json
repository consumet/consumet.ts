  "description": "On Halloween night, a young chimney sweep named Lubicchi befriends a man magically conjured out of garbage. Giving him the name Poupelle, Lubicchi is able to recreate a bond he lost when his father died to the tyranny of the Inquisitorsâ€”an oppressive force that aims to suppress outside knowledge and the town's true history. But their newfound relationship soon captures a lot of attention, and the threat of the Inquisitors and even the criticism of a few townspeople will test the duo's friendship. In spite of this, Poupelle has struck a particular chord with Lubicchi, and the two conspire to bring the truth to the surface and clear the chimney smoke that clouds the town's skies.",
