Despite the odds never being in his favor, he is an unstoppable force that overcomes every opponent, wielding a massive sword larger than himself.\n\nOne day, Griffith, the mysterious leader of the mercenary group Band of the Hawk, witnesses the warrior's battle prowess and invites the wandering swordsman to join his squadron. Rejecting the offer, Guts challenges Griffith to a duelâ€”and, much to the former's surprise, is subsequently defeated and forced to join.\n\nNow, Guts must fight alongside Griffith and his crew to help Midland defeat the Empire of Chuder.
