She has believed her grandmother's story that spirits dwell in words and they are called \"kotodama\" (word spirit). One day, she strays into a mini FM station that has not been used for years. As an impulse of the moment, she tries to talk like a DJ using the facility. But her voice accidentally broadcasted reaches someone she has never expected.",
