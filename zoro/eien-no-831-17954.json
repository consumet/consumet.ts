  "description": "Today, the world is in turmoil due to an \"unprecedented catastrophe.\"\n\nSuzushirou, a young man who lives as a newspaper scholarship student in Tokyo, had a secret that no one could tell.\nAn incident that happened in the summer of my third year of high school\nmade it possible for me to stop the time around me regardless of my will.\n\nOne day, Suzushiro meets a person who can share the secret for the first time.\nLike myself, Nazuna is a girl who has been hurt in her heart and has been able to stop her time.\n\nSuzushiro finds out that she is being used for crimes by her brother Seri, and reaches out impulsively.\n\n\"Let's run away with me!\"\n\nCan they move the time they have stopped again?",
