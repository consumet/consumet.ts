  "description": "Ever since she was young, Yuno has always had an interest in art. Now that she has been accepted to Yamabuki Arts High School, it means one thingâ€”moving out. Living in a dorm at Hidamari Apartments alone, Yuno meets her neighbors: the hyperactive Miyako, the self-conscious Hiro, and the mature Sae. Despite their different personalities, they go to the same school, spend time together, and develop a strong friendship. Yuno's life won't be so lonely after all!\n\nHidamari Sketch revolves around the antics and day-to-day lives of the girls living at Hidamari Apartments.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
