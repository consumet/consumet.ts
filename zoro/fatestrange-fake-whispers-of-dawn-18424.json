  "description": "In a Holy Grail War, Mages (Masters) and their Heroic Spirits (Servants) fight for the control of the Holy Grailâ€”an omnipotent wish-granting device said to fulfill any desire.  Years have passed since the end of the Fifth Holy Grail War in Japan. Now, signs portend the emergence of a new Holy Grail in the western American city of Snowfield.  Sure enough, Masters and Servants begin to gather... A missing Servant class... Impossible Servant summonings... A nation shrouded in secrecy... And a city created as a battleground.  In the face of such irregularities, the Holy Grail War is twisted and driven into the depth of madness.  Let the curtain rise on a masquerade of humans and heroes, made to dance upon the stage of a false Holy Grail.",
