  "description": "A young girl named Candice White who was left on the doorstep of the \"Pony Home\", an orphanage, when she was just a baby. The sisters took her first name from a doll she had in her basket, with the name \"Candy\" on it, and her last name from the snowstorm she was rescued from. Life is quiet and happy.. or.. as quiet as life can be with Candy around. She has a penchant for getting into trouble, climbing trees and tussling with the best of them. However, tragedy begins to strike. \n\n(Source: ANN)",
