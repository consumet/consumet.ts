  "description": "Yuna and Akari are two high school girls with very different views on love: Yuna dreams about romance through rose-coloured glasses, while Akari is down-to-earth and practical. Meanwhile, high school boys Kazuomi and Rio also have different views on love: Kazuomi is an airhead who can't grasp the concept of love, while Rio grabs onto any confession as an opportunityâ€”so long as the girl looks cute. Will these four classmates end up leading a youthful romance that meets their expectations?\n \n(Source: MAL News)",
