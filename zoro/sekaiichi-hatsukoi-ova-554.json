  "description": "Two OVA episodes featuring additional stories. \n\nEpisode 0: Ritsu and Takano used to date back in high school, but broke up due to a misunderstanding. This is that story. \n\nEpisode 12.5: Hatori and Chiaki go to visit the latter's family. It's really awkward in many, many ways.",
