  "description": "It's Kyoto, and yet it is not.\n \nA microcosm of peculiar origins, \"Mirror Kyoto.\"\n \nA small incident causes a young girl, Koto, to wander into this world.\n \nShe runs into a mysterious monk, gets chased around by a tech-obsessed girl, and heartily enjoys her chaotic and colorful new life, but meanwhile, out of sight, a certain plan is being set into motion...\n \nIn this mysterious city where spirits and humans have been thrown together, the festivities are about to begin!\n\n(Source: translated from the official website by lygerzero0zero)",
