Extremely impressed by his skill, Sanshirou decides to become his disciple. Later, Sanshirou falls for Sayo Murai - a girl whose father is a martial arts instructor at the local police department; and he also has to face Higaki Gennosuke, a skilled jujitsu fighter and his greatest rival.\n\nBased on a novel by Tsuneo Tomita, which was adapted into a 1943 movie by young Akira Kurosawa.",
