  "description": "Bramble has always dreamed of becoming a great hero in order to gain recognition from everyone, especially his older brother, Briar. A piece of the alien nucleus that fell from the sky broke the peace of Pine Tree Mountain, but unexpectedly, Bramble merged with the alien nucleus and became a bear with alien wisdom and energy. However, this also brought about the pursuit of \"alien\" Abu who wanted to reclaim the nucleus.",
