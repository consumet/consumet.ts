  "description": "At Hope's Peak Academy, a school full of extraordinarily talented individuals, Nagito Komaeda is an ordinary boy with no special traits or interesting skills to speak ofâ€”except for his incredible unluckiness. Just walking to school in the morning leads to a number of unfortunate accidents, which only escalate as the day goes on. Despite this, Komaeda leads a relatively normal life and is satisfied with his modest slice of happiness.\n\nBut everything changes when a mysterious boy who declares himself the \"Destroyer of the World\" arrives to shatter this hopeless paradise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
