  "description": "Our protagonist, Sumisora Tsubasa, just got a job as a new A&R person at Gandala Music, one of the biggest record companies in the business. Almost like it was a trap, as soon as she started with the company, she was put in charge of the idol unit, \"B-PROJECT.\" Being in charge of B-PROJECT meant that she was in charge of the three groups, \"Kitakore,\" \"THRIVE,\" and \"MooNs.\" Because this is her first job, things don't go that well and she's faced with various trouble and accidents. Be ambitious along with the ten BOYS who are all very different!",
