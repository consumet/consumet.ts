  "description": "Ningen Shikkaku\nA high school student seeks solace in narcotics to escape the dispiritedness that has come over his life. As he goes through the different stages of his life, it culminates in the questioning of his existence in the world.\n\nSakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita\nThe adaptation of Ango Sakaguchi's literary work deals with the love story of a woman abducted by a mountain bandit.\n\nKokoro\nWhile trying to fill the void in his life, a university student in Tokyo encounters a charismatic older man, whom he addresses as \"Sensei,\" who offers him advice on life. However, the man is apprehensive to share his life experience, deepening the student's curiosity. Through this peculiar relationship, the student comes to ponder about the distance between him and his family and the growing desolation in his heart filled with ego and guilt. \n\nHashire, Melos!\nThe story portrays the unbreakable bond between two friends, Melos and Selinuntius, and their faith in protecting each other, all while dangling on a thread which hovers over death and misery. \n\nKumo no Ito\nKandata is a coldhearted criminal who, while being punished in Hell for his misdeeds, is noticed by the Buddha Shakyamuni. Despite maintaining a record of committing ruthless atrocities, Kandata had once shown mercy to a spider he encountered in the forest by letting it live. Moved by this, Shakyamuni offers him redemption by dropping a spider's thread into the searing pits of Hell, and it is up to Kandata to seize the opportunity.\n\nJigokuhen\nYoshihide is a great painter in the land ruled by Horikawa, a tyrant. Offered a commission to paint the \"Buddhist Hell\" by the lord, Yoshihide declines, as he cannot paint anything he has not witnessed himself. In an attempt to make Yoshihide understand the magnitude of his request, the lord tortures his subjects to provide inspiration for the artist, descending his domain into utter despair and darkness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
