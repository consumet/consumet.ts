  "description": "This is a two part story that happened after Rose moved in to Roy's apartment. During the preparations for Appreciation Day, Solty watches people in the city going about and preparing for the celebration and is confronted with a thought: what is true happiness? While trying to understand happiness and the complexity of human emotions, a young girl who has had a falling out with her mother confronts Solty and Rose asking for their help. \"Love Shared\" is actually the second half of \"Opportunities Missed\", while \"Opportunities Missed\" shows the entire story.",
