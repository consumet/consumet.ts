  "description": "In this mixed media stop motion / CG animation short Harbor Tale (ハーバーテイル), Yuuichi Itou anthropomorphises a red brick who has resided on the corner of a red brick building since the times when the clack of geta could be heard on the busy streets of Yokohama.  The building is only a couple of blocks from the harbour and when the building was new the red brick recalls seeing a white sailboat coming into port.",
