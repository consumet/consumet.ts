  "description": "In the Time Nest, headquarters of the Time Patrol, the Supreme Kai of Time informs Xeno Trunks and Xeno Pan that her mystical bird Toki-Toki has disappeared. She sends the two of them to find him, while also being worried about a supposed \"Bird of Catastrophe\" that has been released. Meanwhile, Toki-Toki has appeared on Earth in the main timeline, where Goku finds him while training with Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, Krillin, and Android 17. Xeno Trunks and Xeno Pan arrive and are happy to see that Toki-Toki is safe, with Xeno Pan explaining that his existence is very important for the inner workings of the multiverse. Suddenly, the group is interrupted by the arrival of all twelve Gods of Destruction. Champa identifies Toki-Toki and Beerus promptly attempts to destroy him, but Toki-Toki uses his magic to defuse Beerus's attack. Goku asks Beerus what's going on, and Beerus explains that he has received a premonition that a mysterious bird will appear in Universe 7 and destroy the entire multiverse. Xeno Trunks protests that this couldn't be possible, and Xeno Pan quickly escapes back to the Time Nest with Toki-Toki. Quitela, Champa and the other Gods of Destruction are angered by the mortals' defiance, and immediately prepare to destroy Earth in response, but Beerus tells them to stand down, saying that as Universe 7's God of Destruction, he will discipline the mortals himself. Goku, Vegeta, Xeno Trunks and the others all power up and prepare to fight against Beerus. Meanwhile, Fu observes the scene from an unknown location, saying that this is the start of his new experiment. He now possesses a strange, glowing tree, and a strange bird called \"Doki-Doki\", the true target of the Gods of Destruction, which appears to be an evil version of Toki-Toki.",
